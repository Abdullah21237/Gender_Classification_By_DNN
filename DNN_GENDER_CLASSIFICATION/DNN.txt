Gender Classification using Dense Neural Network Documentation Report
1. Introduction

1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this model is to classify images of male and female faces. It is a binary classification task aimed at distinguishing between male and female faces in images.

1.2 Scope
This model is designed to be used for classifying images of male and female faces. It employs a Deep Neural Network (DNN) architecture and leverages Tensor Flow and Keras for implementation.

2. Data Collection

The dataset used for this model consists of images of male and female faces. The data was collected Kaggle.

3. Data Preprocessing

3.1 Data Directory Structure
The dataset is organized into three directories: "Train (5441 images)," "Validation (2197 images)," and "Test (4482 images)." Each directory contains subdirectories with images of male and female faces.

3.2 Data Augmentation
Data augmentation techniques were applied during training to increase model robustness. These techniques include rotation, width and height shifting, shear, zoom, and horizontal flipping.


4. Model Architecture

The model architecture is a Deep Neural Network (DNN) with the following layers:

- Flatten Layer (Input Layer)
- Dense Layer with 256 units and ReLU activation
- Dropout Layer (40% dropout rate)
- Dense Layer with 128 units and ReLU activation
- Dropout Layer (40% dropout rate)
- Dense Layer with 64 units and ReLU activation
- Dropout Layer (40% dropout rate)
- Dense Layer with 1 unit and Sigmoid activation (Output Layer)

5. Model Training

5.1 Training Parameters
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss Function: Binary Cross-Entropy
- Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall

5.2 Training Process
The model was trained for one epoch due to the limitations of this example. In practice, increasing the number of epochs would likely improve model performance.

6. Model Evaluation

The model was evaluated on a separate test dataset using the following metrics:
- Test Accuracy: 0.6909%
- Test Precision: 0.5104%
- Test Recall: 0.6997%
- F1-Score: 0.5902%
7. Model Predictions

The model made predictions on the test dataset and generated class labels using a threshold of 0.5 for binary classification.

8. Conclusion

In this example, we built a Deep Neural Network model to classify male and female faces from images. The model achieved an accuracy of 0.6909%, precision of 0.5104%, and recall of 0.6997% on the test dataset. Further experimentation with hyper parameters and additional training epochs may lead to improved performance.

Overall, this model can be used as a starting point for similar image classification tasks and can be further refined to achieve higher accuracy.
